LIST OF PROBLEMS: 
-There are no JUnit Tests
-The server is unnecessary and is slowing down the program
-The README file proved to be very vague and not helpful
-chat client is out of place(it doesn't really belong with the programming)
-buttons arent adjusted to one size
-multiple instruments are linked to one sound only(snare) 
-doesnt run on mac
-code is "messy", no real structure/orginization

IMPROVEMENTS
-Adjust button sizes so theyre all the same size
-add clear button to unclick all clicked boxes
-delete server/chat box and "sendit" button 
-add other buttons/features for easier usability (i.e. a copy button that copies first four beats into the rest of the measures.)
-add JUnit tests into the build file
-refactor the classes for clarity and readability purposes (server, gui, track builder, track player, eventlisteners)
-instead of labeling instruments, make them buttons for usability
-marking the down-beats
-adding the possibility for different time signatures
-readjust the midi numbers so that different sounds come out given the sound card
-add a pause button in turn for a stop button; new stop button will also reset beatbhox
